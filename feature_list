The feature list is provided below:

    1. Add API integration with Prescient Weather
        - I believe that this can be added directly with the s2 integration provided
        - We should be able to get all new states added very easily.
        - This should take maybe two to three hours.
        - We need to get the multiprocessing working for all of the relevant states.
    2. I think we should start making predictions as soon as January 1st.
        - There will need to be a month of training or so for each state.
        - We need to add (1) time series adjustments, which will include seasonality, ARMIA, monthly adjustment
        on top of our monthly fits, (2) we should also look to fit slope, seasonality, monthly adjustment, to
        the product.
        - We need to configure AWS to handle multi-core, multi-processor calculation of the residential and commercial
        models using only 1 AWS EC2 computing cluster.
            - This can make this a wrapper around the Residential/Commercial element.
        - We should likely get all of this code ready.
        - We should also add the day of the week.
        - We should also add potential auto regression.
        - We should also look to optimize the natural gas prediction structure.
    3. Clearly, the material built is better than the standard linear regression model, all things being equal.
        - Namely, all of the data is the same in both prediction engines.
        - The difference
    4. We also need the forecast data.
    5. We should look out scoping an integrated balance statistical model.
        - We should make estimates and/or build a quick analysis
    6. We should look to add pipeline data and pipeline framework into the calculations.
    7. We may also want to start looking at the Baker Huges aspect in terms of the production level.
    8.
