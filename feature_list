The feature list is provided below:

    1. To finish the project, we need to accomplish the following:
        a. See the results applied to Virginia Residential for the advanced statistical calculation.
        b. See the results applied to Virginia Residential for the simple linear regression model.
        c. See uplift of one model versus the other model.
        d. Compare against the historical average based model.
        e. Compare against what I was instructed to do at Brevan Howard.
    2. Develop all of the code into rigorous code pathways.
        a. Write tests against all of the relevant code.
    3. Add this code to the relevant APIs.
    4. Add the APIs to the gui code.
        - We can get the GUI code written in parallel to the experimentation.
        - The experimentation may end up taking a while
    5. Create Documentation Describing the different methodologies.
    6. Add forecast estimates also under the different models.
    7. Add analysis of weather data into the models.
        - Compare accuracy of the weather data.
    8. Investigate the ensemble-like techniques.
    9. We can take the approach of making the design modular, so that implementation can occur without
    requiring all the pieces to first be aligned.
    10. Really, all we need to do is develop, the relevant parameter format

     Training  -----------> Develop Parameters -----------------> Inference--------------> Predictions.

     Training to get a high accuracy may take some time to figure out.
     But the rest of the pipeline can and should be implemented while we are experimenting to get the
     Training correct in parallel.


    Additional Questions:
    -----------------------

     How long do we think it will take us to get all of these components lined up.

     I think it could take us 2 days to get a first pass setup for everything.

     We should also look to get feedback from Tony on whether it is worth the time keeping around our competitors
     estimates of Natural Gas Consumption.

        - We can get this packaged and sent over to Tony.

     I think that setting up the entire GUI should not take that long.

     I think that nailing down the
