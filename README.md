The codebase calculates Natural Gas Consumption using EIA Data, Weather Data and Census Data. The codebases uses techniques from probabilistic programming and global optimization. We are still running the code to
see how much uplift the code provides over basic guessing and the Brevan Howard consumption methods. 

The current method achieves a 3% relative error for Virginia Residential Consumption. The historical, base line control method achieves a 15% relative error for Virginia Residential Consumption.
